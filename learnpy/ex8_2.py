A. Create three functions in three separate modules and put them in a show_version directory (in practice you wouldn't do this--you would just have them all in one file, but this will let you experiment with packages).
  1. Function1 = obtain_os_version -- process the show version output and return the OS version (Version 15.0(1)M4) else return None.
  2. Function2 = obtain_uptime -- process the show version output and return the network device's uptime string (uptime is 12 weeks, 5 days, 1 hour, 4 minutes) else return None.
  3. Function3 = obtain_model -- process the show version output and return the model (881) else return None.
